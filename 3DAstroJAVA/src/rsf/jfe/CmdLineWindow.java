// This can be used to create a window that lets the user type text, but not use the mouse.
// It should act much like a window onto the command-line, so the user can backspace within
// a line, but not backspace to edit a previous line.
//
// This does not act exactly like the command-line because it doesn't have three truly 
// distinct streams for in, out and err. It approximates this by assuming that anything that
// comes in via takeChar() gets printed to the window. This effectively collapses out and err
// into one stream. Stdin is approximated by saying that whenever the user types return, then
// anything that appears in theText after the character most recently added by takeChar() is
// passed to a LineListener. Normally, these characters would be anything the user typed
// since the last call to takeChar(). If there are multiple threads calling takeChar(), and 
// the user is typing at the same time, then, when the user hits return, the LineListener 
// might not receive everything the user typed since the last time he hit return, which is 
// the ideal solution. To do that would require an extra buffer layer to hold everything the
// user types separately. The CmdLineDocFilter is where the user's text (i.e., when they hit
// return) is noted and passed along to the listener.
