// A class for listening to WindowListener events, and ignoring all of them except the 
// window close event, which causes the entire program to terminate.
//
// This is handy because it occurs so often. Rather than defining all of these methods in
// each JFrame, just say
// this.addWindowListener(new WindowQuitter());
// However, this class is primarily meant as an example. Calling
// JFrame.setDefaultCloseOperation(EXIT_ON_CLOSE) instead of addWindowListener()
// does the same thing.
